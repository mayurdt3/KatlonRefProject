# Katalon-Platform-WebUITesting

Katalon Platform is a software quality management platform that enables you to conduct the entire software testing life cycle (STLC) and deliver high-quality software in every release. It offers different modules and solutions for each phase of the testing cycle, including test planning, authoring, organizing, executing, and analyzing.

Katalon and use different techniques and low-code solutions to create, organize, manage, execute automated tests in different environments, and manage reports in one single platform.

Katalon supports three methods to create automated tests: Record and Playback, using keywords in the Manual Mode, and scripting in the Script Mode.

Record and Playback is a great solution to start for beginners and non-programmers. But to improve the test quality as time goes on, they should learn how to use the built-in keywords in the Manual Mode and ultimately get down to scripting to have more control over the test design.

## Planing (Katalon TestOps)

In Katalon TestOps, you can plan tests with releases and builds, then schedule test runs. Katalon also has a seamless integration with Jira to help manage releases and requirements. 
 
## Test creating (Katalon Studio)

In Katalon Studio, you can create, execute and view basic reports for your web, API, mobile, and desktop automated tests with both manual view and script view.

## Organizing (Katalon TestOps, Katalon Studio)

Katalon Studio	Once done designing your tests, you can organize them in test suites or dynamic test suites in Katalon TestOps or Katalon Studio.

## Executing (Katalon TestCloud, Katalon Runtime Engine)

Katalon TestCloud is a cloud-based test execution environment equipped with the most common browsers and operating systems.

Katalon Runtime Engine is the test execution add-on of Katalon Studio for executing and scheduling tests in CI/CD pipeline or via the command-line interface.

## Maintaining	(Katalon Studio)	

Katalon Studio provides several methods to handle errors during test execution and fixing tests so they stay up to date with code changes. These features can reduce your test maintenance efforts substantially.

## Data-Driven Testing:
Data-Driven Testing, Katalon Studio supports various types of data files to which you can bind variables, including internal data in Katalon Studio, external data files such as MS Excel and CSV files, and any Java Database Connectivity (also known as JDBC) sources like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and MS SQL Server.
 - First of all, more test data means higher test coverage and higher chances of bug detection. 
 - Second, Data-Driven Testing saves up time and resources since you don't need to create and run many test cases for each set of test data, hence, minimizing the duplicate codes and work. Also, it's easy for you to maintain. 
 - Test data, including test inputs and expected outputs, are stored separately from test scripts. 
 - You can change, update, or add new data to the data file without changing anything in the script.
